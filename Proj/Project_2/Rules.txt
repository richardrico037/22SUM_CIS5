"HOW TO PLAY CRAPS" 

1. All craps games begin with a pass line bet. (Players start off with $1000)
A craps player must choose whether they think the dice will land on a combined 7 or 11 to win ('pass the line') or lose by landing on a 2, 3 or 12.

2. The base dealers take all pass bets and add them to the craps table.

3. The shooter starts the craps game with the first roll of the dice, known as the comeout roll.

4.If the dice land on 7 or 11, pass line bettors win their wager.
Alternately, if the dice land on a combined 2, 3 or 12, don't pass bettors win.
Any other numbers the dice land on establishes a 'point' on the craps table, and the game continues.

5. Once a point (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) is set on the craps table,
craps players can bet on the dice landing the point or landing on 7.

6. The shooter rolls the dice until they land a 7 or the point.
